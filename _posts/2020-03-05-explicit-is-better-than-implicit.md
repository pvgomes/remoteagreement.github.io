"Explicit is better than implicit - The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters"

This came from code development, but we can use it for life and work, sometimes we think that something it's very obvious that there's no necessary be explicit in our communication, but it isn't really true, people are different, have different know-how, knowledge, and culture, be explicit its good to make sure that everything is clear and people understand what do you want to say or pass, this helps to avoid simple mistakes, its basically the essence of [checklist manifest](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000)


Somethings in the Zend of Python that we can use to essence of this agreement

```
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the idea is hard to explain, it may be a bad idea.
If the idea is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
```
