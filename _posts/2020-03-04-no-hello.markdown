# Avoid to say hello in chat (slack, skype...)

**example**

|  who  | message  |
|-------|-------|
| you  | Hi   |
| friend  |  waits while you phrase your question  |
| you  | I'm working on [something], and I'm trying to do [etc...]  |
| you  | wait while your friend phrases their answer  |
| friend  | Oh, that;s [answer...]  |

It’s as if you called someone on the phone and said “Hi!” and then put them on hold, its synchronous/blocked conversation which make a non productive day

**Do this instead** (asynchronous/non blocking)

|  who  | message  |
|-------|-------|
| you  | Hi, I'm working on [something], and I'm trying to do [etc...]  |
| friend  | Oh, that;s [answer...]  |
